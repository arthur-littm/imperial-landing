                </p>
                <p>You'll spend the last two weeks on a group project working on an exciting data science problem you want to solve! As a team, you'll learn how to collaborate efficiently on a real data science project through a common Python repository and the Git flow. You will use a mix of your own datasets (if you have any from your company / non-profit organisation) and open-data <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/" target="_blank">repositories</a> (Government initiatives, Kaggle, etc.). It will be a great way to practise all the tools, techniques and methodologies covered in the Data Science Course and will make you realize how autonomous you have become.</p>
