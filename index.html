                <p>You'll spend the last two weeks on a group project working on an exciting data science problem you want to solve! As a team, you'll learn how to collaborate efficiently on a real data science project through a common Python repository and the Git flow. You will use a mix of your own datasets (if you have any from your company / non-profit organisation) and open-data <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/" target="_blank">repositories</a> (Government initiatives, Kaggle, etc.). It will be a great way to practise all the tools, techniques and methodologies covered in the Data Science Course and will make you realize how autonomous you have become.</p>

          <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
          <p>Our course is very intensive and will jump into advanced topics from the very first week. The course is designed for people with basic coding skills in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Maths</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Python: You must be comfortable with data types & variables, conditions, loops, functions and the two data structures list & dict</li>
            <li>Maths: A minimum A-Level qualification or equivalent in Maths is required for the bootcamp, as we need you to be comfortable with functions, their derivatives and systems of linear equations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To get up to speed, some <a href="https://lew.ag/data-prepwork" target="_blank">preparation work</a> is given to applicants before the bootcamp starts. We have a Python Technical Test as part of the admissions process to make sure you are at the right level to make the bootcamp a success.</p>
